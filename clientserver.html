<h1>Client/Server Computing</h1>

<p>By: Ahmad Fadel</p>

<h2>What is the client/server model?</h2>

<p>The client/server model acts as a core network which enables building functionality for web technologies.  These Clients include Web browsers, chat applications, and email software, among others. Servers include Web, database, application, chat and email, etc.  Clients request specific processes and data and the server relays process output to the client</p>

<h2>Advantages of the client/server model</h2>

<p>Several major advantages of the client/server model are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Security:Password management provides a security measurement for this by requiring a minimum amount of characters to be used in passwords checking passwords for guess-ability, and regularly asking users to change their passwords
	<li>Accessibility:You can access many different servers and databases
	<li> Centralization:It's used with general-purpose computer systems, single user system, and multi user system
	<li>Proper Management:The communication between clients and servers is a two way street. Servers can contact clients to ensure that the client has appropriate patches, updates, or to see if the client needs anything else
</ol>

<h2>Examples of TCP/IP protocols</h2>

<ul>
	<li>FTP-FileZilla,WinSCP,Cyberduck
	<li>HTTP-is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems
	<li>HTTPS-is the secure version of HTTP
	<li>DHCP-is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway
	<li>SMPT-Yahoo,Hotmail,Outlook,Gmail
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Network Utilities and Services</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Ping-Tests connectivity between two hosts
    
	<li>Tracert-Identifies pathways taken along each hop, rather than the time it takes for each packet to return
    
	<li>Pathping-Provides useful information about network latency and network loss at intermediate hops between a source address and a destination address
    
	<li><a href="https://whois.icann.org/en">Whois</a> -Is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assignees of an Internet resource
    
	<li>IPConfig-Command line utility will show detailed information about the network you are connected too
    
</ul>
